Hello! Thanks for contributing.

The answers to many "how do I...?" questions can be found in our [help documentation](https://mapbox.com/help). If you can't find the answer there, the best place to ask is either [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mapbox-gl-js) or [Mapbox support](https://mapbox.com/contact/).

However, if you have a question that isn't addressed in the documentation but should be, please do let us know by filling out the template below!  As a general rule, if a question is about _how Mapbox GL JS works_ rather than your specific use case, we will try to address it here or by improving the documentation.  Otherwise, we might close the issue here and instead recommend asking on Stack Overflow or contacting support.
